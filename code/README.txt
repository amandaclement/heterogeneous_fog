COMP 371 Project - Real-time Rendering of Heterogeneous Fog
By Amanda Clement / 40136259

** This is just a quick intro to the project. See the report for more details **

Motivation
My primary goal for this project was to render heterogeneous fog, which is a type of fog where the density varies across the scene. 
My intention was to find a middle-ground between homogeneous fog, which is applied uniformly across the scene and therefore lacks a 
sense of realism, and volumetric fog which appears realistic but is computationally expensive to render.

Description
The heterogeneous fog model augments exponential fog by integrating Perlin turbulence into the equation, which involves the layering 
of Perlin noise octaves to achieve a greater amount of detail and shape than Perlin noise alone. The resulting fog factor is then used 
to blend the fogâ€™s color with the scene colors and the result is be presented to the user, along with some tools that will allow them to 
interact with the scene to explore the real-time fog rendering.
 
Objectives
    1. Implement Perlin noise, generating noise octave textures with it
    2. Implement Perlin turbulence by layering the Perlin noise octaves
    3. Compute the fog factor by implementing Perlin turbulence into the exponential fog equation
    4. Create an OpenGL scene and blend the fog color with the scene colors
    5. Add features allowing user to interact with the fog and the scene (e.g. camera controls)

Libraries Used:
    - GLEW
    - GLFW
    - GLM
    - IMGUI

* The .exe file is titled "fog" (in the build folder)
